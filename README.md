# Legends Viewer

This is an attempt to create a __Linux Port__ of the great Legends Viewer by [Parker147](https://github.com/Parker147/Legends-Viewer).

## Some info on this branch

- I am a programmer, though not a C# programmer. I'm not entirely sure about what I'm doing here.
- I followed guidelines from [this post](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=72702.msg5832031#msg5832031) by [rmblr](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=61461), a bay 12 user to fix the program so it can run on mono on linux.
- I hope that we can create a version of this program that runs both on windows and mono (linux, osx and eventually bsd) so that it can become truly multiplatform if possible. If not possible, at least we can have a linux branch.

## What does not work

Almost everything. The map works though.

## How to get it to run

I only tested on Arch Linux. Steps that I did to run the program:
- Install `monodevelop` and `webkit-sharp` from the repositories.
- Open the solution file in monodevelop and press the big run button

I guess when it works (or if it works) we'll have binaries and packages.
